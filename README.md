#  Smart MediBox

## Introduction

**Smart MediBox** is an intelligent pharmaceutical storage solution developed using ESP32 and embedded systems technologies. This project was completed in **two phases**:

- **Phase 1**: focused on building a basic medicine reminder system with alarm and environmental monitoring features.
- **Phase 2**: extended the project by integrating dynamic light control, servo motor adjustment, and real-time dashboard visualization via Node-RED.

---

## System Overview

The MediBox combines hardware and software to support:

- Timely medication reminders
- Continuous monitoring of environmental conditions
- Light sensitivity management for medicine storage
- A responsive UI and remote dashboard integration

## Core Functionalities

### Phase 1: Basic Features
- **Time Synchronization** via NTP with time zone configuration
- **Alarm Management**: Set, view, delete, and snooze alarms
- **OLED Display**: Shows current time, active alarms, and warning messages
- **Alarm Notification**: Audible alerts using a buzzer
- **Environmental Monitoring**:
  - Monitors temperature and humidity using DHT11
  - Alerts if out of healthy range (24°C–32°C, 65%–80% RH)

### Phase 2: Advanced Features 
- **Light Intensity Monitoring**:
  - Uses LDR sensors
  - Configurable sampling and update intervals (default: 5s & 2min)
  - Normalized values (0–1) sent to Node-RED dashboard
- **Servo Motor Controlled Shaded Window**:
  - Adjusts based on light and temperature using a custom equation
  - User-configurable parameters:  
    - Minimum angle (θoffset)  
    - Controlling factor (γ)  
    - Ideal temperature (Tmed)
- **Node-RED Dashboard**:
  - Realtime plots, gauges, and sliders for parameter control
  - Remote monitoring and adjustments via MQTT

## Software Architecture

### 1. **Hardware Abstraction Layer**
- Encapsulates OLED, buttons, buzzer, LDR, DHT11, and servo motor

### 2. **Sensor Management**
- Collects, processes, and transmits temperature, humidity, and light intensity

### 3. **Alarm Management**
- Schedules, triggers, and manages alarms with persistent storage

### 4. **Time Management**
- NTP-based clock with user-settable time zones and backup storage

### 5. **User Interface**
- Menu-driven OLED interface navigated via push buttons

### 6. **Communication Layer**
- MQTT-based data exchange with Node-RED
- Subscribes to control topics and publishes sensor readings
